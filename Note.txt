I just wanted to say thank you for being such a great teacher Jolanta. You did an incredible job teaching the content. Thank you as well for being understanding when I was sick. I wish we had more courses together, your lessons were well planned and easy to follow. I also appreciated all the extra work you made available to us for practice.

P.S: Because you liked her so much, I attached a photo of my cat for you
